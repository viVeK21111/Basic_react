In a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React Router, clicking on a link (such as "About")
 doesn't cause a full page reload, but it does navigate to a new route, which can feel like 
navigating to a new page. React Router handles this navigation by updating the URL and rendering
 the corresponding component without reloading the entire page.
